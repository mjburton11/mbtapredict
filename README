This project is a very simple way to get the next departure time
at an MBTA stop, requiring user to input route, stop and direction.

Use case is as follows:

>> from mbtapredict import predict_departure
>> predict_departure()

This will prompt the user for 3 inputs: route, stop and direction,
unless the stop is at the end point of one of the routes,
in which case it assumes the user is going the opposite direction and
will only be prompted for route and stop.
